- **Data Ingestion**: Handles input data efficiently and ensures robust preprocessing.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies feature engineering techniques for model-ready datasets.
- **Model Training**: Includes hyperparameter tuning using **Grid Search** to select the optimal model.
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Uses the best-performing model to generate predictions.

### 🌐 **Deployment**
- Fully deployed on **Microsoft Azure**, ensuring scalability and accessibility.
- Integrated **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### 🖥️ **Interactive User Interface**
- A sleek and responsive web interface built using **Flask**, **HTML**, and **Bootstrap**.
- **Home Page**: Welcomes users with an overview of the application.
- **Form**: Asks essential questions to determine loan approval status.

### 🛡️ **Robust Utilities**
- **Custom Exception Handling**: Simplifies debugging with meaningful error messages.
- **Logging System**: Generates detailed logs to monitor application performance.
- **Reusable Utility Functions**: Includes modular functions like `load_object`, `save_object`, and `_evaluate_models` for streamlined workflows.
